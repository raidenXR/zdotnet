This repository contains a collection of several classes from .NET API implemented with Zig, to make  
working with Zig less frustrating, (i.e have some familiar classes from .NET).   

- String
- StringBuilder
- Numerics
- ArrayPool

the `src/dotnet.zig` is defined as a package in `build.zig` and `build.zig.zon`, so it can be   
easily imported to other zig projects.   


**EDIT:** change the origin in .git to, and use this repo from now on, as the port with Zig for   
the dotnet classes.
